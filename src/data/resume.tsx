  summary:
    "Been hitting semicolons since 7th grade, and since then have fallen in love building software with the big toy (computer). Have built mobile apps and websites over the cloud that scaled over hundreds of users [for various startups](/work) and for the ones I co-founded. I love contributing to open source software and also have a lot of my own OSS [projects](/#projects). Cracked the AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert in a month, won three prizes at the [first hackathon I participated in](https://parablerhythm.parameater.co/) with a crime thriller game powered by Generative A.I, a roblox dev (sometimes) with over 500K player visits (guess then that makes me an award winning game-dev too). Oh yes, I'm also a [computer science student.](/work#education)",
